"# mGAN-AI" 

Based on the images and information provided, I can help you design the structure of the project and create a directory structure for the experiment. The experiment involves federated learning, specifically targeting privacy leakage using mGAN-AI. Here's a proposed directory structure and high-level implementation plan:

### **Proposed Directory Structure:**

```
project/
│
├── config/                   # Configuration files for different components (e.g., model settings, dataset configurations)
│   ├── federated_config.py   # Federated learning parameters (e.g., number of clients, training rounds)
│   └── mgan_config.py        # mGAN-AI specific configuration (e.g., generator and discriminator hyperparameters)
│
├── data/                     # Dataset storage and processing
│   ├── mnist/                # MNIST dataset (training and testing data)
│   └── utils.py              # Data preprocessing utilities (e.g., loading, splitting, augmentation)
│
├── models/                   # Model definition files

│   ├── passive_attack.py     # Implementation of the passive mGAN-AI attack
│   ├── active_attack.py      # Implementation of the active mGAN-AI attack
│   └── utils.py              # Utility functions for attack (e.g., data representative calculation)

│   └── plot_results.py       # Generate plots for results (e.g., training curves, attack results)
│
├── logs/                     # Logging files for experiments (e.g., training logs, evaluation logs)
│

```

### **High-Level Design Plan for Code Implementation:**

1. **Federated Learning Setup**:
   - The training process in federated learning requires multiple clients. Each client performs local training on its own data and sends updates to the server, which averages the updates and sends the model back.
   - Implement a `FederatedModel` class to handle the model updates, averaging, and synchronization.

2. **mGAN-AI Attack**:
   - The `mGAN-AI` attack will be implemented in two forms: passive and active.
   - For the passive attack, updates from all clients are used to update the shared model and generate fake samples.
   - The active attack will involve isolating the victim and training mGAN-AI on the victim’s data only.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Data will be preprocessed for the MNIST dataset (or AT&T dataset, depending on the experiment).
   - Implement `data/utils.py` for handling data splitting, randomization, and loading.

4. **Model Definitions**:
   - Use `models/classifier.py` to define the architecture of the federated learning model (likely a simple CNN or MLP).
   - Define the architecture of the discriminator and generator in `models/discriminator.py` and `models/generator.py`, respectively, following the network structure described in Table I and based on InfoGAN principles.

5. **Attack Implementation**:
   - Passive and active attacks will use a custom attack implementation. For both, implement the function for data representative calculation, as described in the algorithm, using backpropagation and optimization techniques.

6. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - The `train.py` script will orchestrate federated learning, where the model is trained on local data from each client.
   - Use `evaluate.py` to evaluate both the original model's performance and the effectiveness of mGAN-AI in reconstructing the victim's private data.
   - `plot_results.py` will help visualize results (accuracy, reconstruction quality, and privacy leakage).

7. **Logging**:
   - Ensure that logs are saved for each experiment, especially the results of attacks and model performance metrics, so they can be reviewed later.

This structure should allow for efficient experimentation with federated learning and mGAN-AI-based privacy attacks. Would you like me to help further develop specific scripts or provide detailed code examples for any part of this?
